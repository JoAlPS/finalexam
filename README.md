# This class was a total challenge for me, even though I knew how to do some things, beaceuse it wasn't my first time programming, the way in which we did it was totally new for me, so this was a challenge because I needed to learn how to programm it because I knew how to do it but not programming it, I really enjoyed the class because I learnt new ways to do things and learn new things too like machine learning, I think this will help me a lot with my professional life, and will be really useful.
